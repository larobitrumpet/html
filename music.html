                                        <p>This is the Granite Bay Emerald Brigade performing our 2018 field show "Odyssey to a New World" at Folsom high school. The show follows the journey of a traveler taking the Transcontinental Railroad west to the "New World". The our season was cut short due to forest fires causing the air quality be deemed unsafe for field shows, and thus we were never able to perform this field show in a WBA circuit. The show we performed at Folsom is unfinished, but it was the last show we were able to perform. Music includes music from New World Symphony by Antonín Dvořák.</p>
