                        <h3>Guessing Game</h3>
                        <p>This is a simple python console application that I built when I was first learning Python. A number between 1 and 10 is picked at random. 2 players guess the number and who ever guesses the closest wins.</p>

                        <h3>Board Game</h3>
                        <p>This is a simple board game that I built when I first started learning python. It is a console application in which you race against another player to get to the end. It includes a number of special spaces that do various things.</p>

                        <h3>Multi Board Tic Tac Toe Game with AI</h3>
                        <p>This is a project that I created for the AP Computer Science Principles test. It is a python console application in which you can play tic tac toe with multiple boards. It can be played with 2 players or with an AI. It isn't so much and "AI" as an algorithm that can win whenever it is mathematically possible.</p>

                        <h3>Digital Character Sheet</h3>
                        <p>This is a project I created for my Technology Innovation class. It is a web application that helps you create a Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition character. It's goal is to help speed up the character creation process and to make that process easier for new player's to understand. Currently it is more of a proof of concept as there are many things that currently don't work correctly and there are some major features missing.</p>

                        <h3>Scratch Game</h3>
                        <p>This is a game I built in Scratch as part of my Introduction to Computer Science class. It is a dungeon crawler in which you make your way through the various levels of a dungeon. The description at the beginning implies that there is an end to the dungeon when in reality it goes on forever.</p>
