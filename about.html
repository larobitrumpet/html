        <p>I am ***DEADNAME*** Robillard. I graduated high school at Granite Bay High School in 2020 and am currently a student at Sierra College. I enjoy programming and computer science and you will find some of my projects on this website. I also enjoy science and mathematics. I am a musician and have been playing trumpet for 9 years. I did marching band in high school where I competed with the Granite Bay Emerald Brigade where we competed in WBA and won state champs for class 4A in 2017 with our show "Flight 19: Lost in the Bermuda Triangle". During my sophomore year of high school I played vibraphone in the front ensemble for that marching season. I also played synthesizer for winter percussion where we competed in NCPA and WGI. I also played trumpet in the Granite Bay Jazz Band my last two years of high school. We (the Granite Bay Concert Band) have also played at the Kennedy Center in Washington D.C. and at Carnegie Hall in New York, which were very increadible and rewarding expiriences. I look forward to pursuing music, science, mathematics, computer science, and other interest in the future.</p>
